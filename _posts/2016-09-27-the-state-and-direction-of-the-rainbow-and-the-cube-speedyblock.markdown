It's been a year since the last update for my upcoming iPhone game. What new features did we make? What designs did we change? Let's get right to it...

Here's the latest build screen shot, I think our players will love it. It's colorful, responsive and clean. This design is thanks to our designer Dali Liu, my best friend, and Sam Anderson, Dali's roommate. I flew to San Francisco to meet them, and we worked for an entire week, 24/7. The work we did together for "Rainbow and the Cube" was exciting, engaging and a memory of a lifetime for me.

Thoughts and changes
===
The game has come a long way, but it has also updating slowly. But on the bright side, the week in San Francisco, with Dali and Sam, our designers, were spectacular; We got a month worth of work done compared to if I were just to work on my own. Completely reworked the color schemes, revised the UI design and added a core game mechanic. We kept coming up with ideas together during brainstorms, mostly thanks to Sam who's particularly good at organizing brainstorm sessions.

One of the great ideas related to the core game-play is _Rainbow Mode_. The player will now get point-multiplier-bonus (x2,x4,x8) starting from the 3rd perfect turn. The motivation behind this idea is that our game lacks stake and building tension; there is nothing to lose when the player makes a bad turn. Rainbow Mode provides stake and tension by rewarding the player to be consistent. Imagine you have a 20 perfect streak and your multiplier is at 16x more points per turn, your heart hammers, and my heads go sweaty. 

At this point, the game mechanics are all finished, but there's a lot of polishing left to do. Menu animations, implementing new designs, fine tuning special FX, bug fixing. Marketing is contently on my mind, which is the reason why I'm writing this post, to give this game more exposure. I project that this game will be release during or shortly after Winter Break.
