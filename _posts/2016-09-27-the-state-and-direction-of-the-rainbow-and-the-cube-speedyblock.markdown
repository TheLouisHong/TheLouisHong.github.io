The last update for my iPhone game was a year ago. What new features did we create? What designs did we change? Let's get right to it...

---
Here's the latest build screenshot, I think our players will love it. It's colorful, responsive and clean. This design is thanks to our designer Dali Liu, my best friend, and Sam Anderson, Dali's roommate. I flew to San Francisco to meet them, and we worked for an entire week, 24/7. The work we did together for "Rainbow and the Cube" was exciting, engaging and a memory of a lifetime for me.

The game has come a long way, albeit rather slowly. But we got a month worth of work done in a week when I flew over to Dali and Sam in San Francisco and I'm very happy with that. We've completely reworked the color schemes, revised the UI design and added a core game mechanic. Let me explain some of the major updates.

Mechanics: _New Rainbow Mode_
---
We have a new mechanic called _Rainbow Mode_. The player will now get point-multiplier-bonus (x2,x4,x8) starting from the 3rd perfect turn. The perfect turn the multiplier is terminated when the player fails to perform a perfect turn. Rainbow Mode rewards the player exponentially for being consistent. Imagine you've made 20 perfect turns in a row, and your multiplier is at 16x more points per turn, my heart hammers, and my heads go sweaty, I want to keep the points coming. The motivation behind this idea is that before our game lacks stake and building tension, that there is nothing to lose when the player makes a bad turn. 

Music: _New Rainbow Music_
---
For the new Rainbow Mode, we have created a unique rainbow map skin and theme song. Aria (Citric Aria) Deng, our audio engineer, and designer has created new music just for it ("Rainbow Rode"). The music is a perfect match for the mode, it is trippy, short and it loops. We made it like this so we can switch back and forth from the main theme song to the rainbow mode theme song during play. Again and again, Aria surprises the team again and again with his incredible musical talent. He understands music like no one else does and has a thorough understanding of the science of sound and music theory. We're lucky to have Aria part of the team.

Design: _New UI, New Colors_
---
The color design are much more diverse and interesting maps for the player to explore. Like before, these maps skin will change based on what level the player is in, making new high scores more memorable. To  I rewrote our map skin code and created a nice editor for the designers to experiment with colors in-game real-time. For the first time I've made use of the custom editor feature and it has immediately paid off. The designers had a tremendous time designing the colors with the editors, ultimately came up with 5 new color schemes.

Future

I will finish and polish the menu and polish the game play. The goal is to have Apple feature us on the App Store. If we want this game to be featured by Apple! We need to be bug-less & smooth experience.
