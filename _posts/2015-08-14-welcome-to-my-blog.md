###Welcome!
I'm going to DigiPen Institute Of Techonlogy to study Game Design & Computer Science after summer; Which is less then 2 weeks away. I'm going to start my blog so I can remind my self and other people the amazing things I've done and how amazing I am.

Super excited! I know I will meet many people who have the same passion for game development as I do, I know I will meet experienced professionals who will guide me and educate me to make the games I want. I will make games, furiously. I will make history and I will not be forgotten.

Good luck to myself, and the people I will meet.
